# AutonomousTurtleMiner
A fully autonomous turtle miner for the FTB Ultimate Reloaded minecraft modpack

Requires ender chests that act as fuel input and mineable output
The onboard chunk loader must be loaded by a player once it has been unloaded by a server restart
There is no practical way around this issue and is a limitation of the chunk loader
